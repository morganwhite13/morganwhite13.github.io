# Welcome! I'm Morgan White 👋

I'm a **Computer Science Honours Graduate** (CGPA: 10.92/12) from Carleton University, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. I bridge the gap between cutting-edge research and practical industry applications, from multi-agent reinforcement learning to production-ready automation tools.

## What I Do

I build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. My work spans:

**Professional AI Development:**
- Developed an AI classification tool at the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency** that reduced manual data entry from 80% to 20% of analyst time—automating classification of 90,000+ food product rows with over 80% precision

**Research Contributions:**
- Conducted **Honours research** on cooperative agent behaviors using Unity ML-Agents, investigating how elimination mechanisms affect multi-agent cooperation in Sequential Social Dilemmas
- Published research on **MARL robustness** for agent blindness in VMAS, achieving 86% performance improvement through systematic hyperparameter optimization

**Full-Stack AI Projects:**
- Built autonomous robotics systems with computer vision and sensor fusion (100% success rate)
- Developed deep learning models for financial prediction and content analytics
- Created native iOS applications with custom UI components and secure authentication

I combine strong theoretical foundations in algorithms, machine learning, and mathematics with the ability to deliver production-ready code.
