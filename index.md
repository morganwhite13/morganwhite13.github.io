# Welcome! I'm Morgan White 👋

I'm a Computer Science Graduate (Honours) from Carleton University, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. I am passionate about bridging the gap between advanced research and practical industry solutions, ranging from Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) to automated data processing tools.

## What I Do

I build intelligent systems that optimize workflows and solve complex behavioral problems. My recent work includes developing NLP classification tools for the **Canadian Food Inspection Agency** that reduced manual data entry by 80%, and conducting Honours research on cooperative agent behaviors using **Unity ML-Agents**.

I combine a strong theoretical foundation in algorithms and mathematics with the ability to execute production-ready code.

## Technical Skills

**Languages:** Python, Java, C++, C#, Prolog, SQL
**AI & ML:** Unity ML-Agents, Reinforcement Learning (PPO, SAC, POCA), NLP (TF-IDF, Lemmatization), Scikit-learn, Pandas
**Concepts:** Functional Programming, Multi-Agent Systems, Game Theory, Agile Development
**Tools:** Git & GitHub, Version Control
