## 🤖 Autonomous Robot Jar Collection System

**Tech Stack:** Webots R2025a, Java, Computer Vision, Robotics, Sensor Fusion

Built a fully autonomous mobile robot system that navigates a 20×20 meter warehouse, detects honey jars using color-based computer vision, manipulates objects with a gripper, and places them in designated storage areas. The robot combines multiple sensor modalities (camera, compass, distance sensors, touch sensor) with real-time path planning to autonomously complete complex manipulation tasks.

**Key Achievements:**
- 100% success rate collecting 4 objects without human intervention
- ±3° heading accuracy and ±10cm position accuracy in 20m arena
- Multi-layer object detection with fallback logic for robust operation
- Real-time sensor fusion combining vision, compass, and distance data
- 800+ lines of optimized Java controller code

## 📱 Morgan's Reviews - iOS App

**Tech Stack:** Swift, UIKit, MVC Pattern, Mobile Development

A native iOS application for tracking and reviewing entertainment media. Features a custom-built interactive star rating system, table view data management, and an admin authentication flow for content management. Designed to provide a spoiler-free environment for sharing honest reviews on movies and games.

**Key Achievements:**
- Developed a custom `@IBDesignable` UI control for star ratings with accessibility support.
- Implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
- Built a secure navigation flow with admin authentication logic.
- Integrated `UIImagePickerController` for handling user-generated media.
