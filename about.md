# About Me

Hi! I'm Alex Chen, a Computer Science student at State University expected to graduate in May 2025. I'm passionate about building software that solves real problems and makes people's lives easier.

## My Journey

My journey into programming started in high school when I built my first website. Since then, I've been hooked on the creative problem-solving aspect of software development. I love the moment when a complex algorithm finally works or when a user interface comes together perfectly.

During my time at university, I've taken courses in:
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Database Systems
- Machine Learning
- Software Engineering
- Computer Networks
- Operating Systems

## What Drives Me

I'm motivated by projects that have real impact. Whether it's building a tool that saves developers time, creating an app that helps people manage their finances, or contributing to open-source software used by thousands, I want my work to matter.

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- Reading tech blogs and staying current with industry trends
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Playing basketball or hiking
- Experimenting with new technologies and frameworks
- Attending local tech meetups

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm deepening my knowledge in:
- Cloud architecture (AWS, Azure)
- System design and scalability
- Advanced React patterns
- Machine learning deployment

## Experience

**Software Engineering Intern** - TechCorp Inc. (Summer 2024)
- Developed RESTful APIs serving 10,000+ daily requests
- Reduced query response time by 40% through database optimization
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams using Agile methodologies

**Teaching Assistant** - State University (2023-2024)
- Assisted in teaching "Introduction to Programming" course
- Held weekly office hours and graded assignments
- Mentored 30+ students on programming fundamentals

## Education

**Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**  
State University | Expected Graduation: May 2025  
GPA: 3.8/4.0  
Relevant Coursework: Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, Database Systems

## Let's Work Together

I'm actively seeking full-time software engineering positions starting in June 2025. I'm particularly interested in roles involving full-stack development, backend systems, or machine learning.
