# About Morgan White

I'm a recent Computer Science Honours graduate from Carleton University, specializing in **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. My work focuses on developing and deploying intelligent, data-driven systems that solve real-world problems and significantly improve operational efficiency.

## My Impact

My career journey has been shaped by roles that demand both deep academic rigor and practical engineering discipline:

* **AI Developer at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA):** I engineered an NLP-based classification solution that automated the processing of over 90,000 product data rows. This system achieved high accuracy and resulted in a **80% reduction in manual data collection workload** for analysts, allowing them to shift focus to higher-value analysis.
* **Honours Research:** I designed a custom **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)** environment using **Unity ML-Agents** to investigate cooperative agent behaviors under social dilemmas. My research involved implementing and comparing advanced algorithms, including **PPO** and **SAC**, providing insights into how elimination mechanisms influence group dynamics.
* **Teaching Assistant:** As a TA for **Programming Paradigms (Haskell/Prolog)** and **Introduction to AI**, I mentored students in core computer science principles, from functional programming concepts to complex heuristic search algorithms.

## Technical Expertise

I possess a strong, specialized technical skillset:

* **AI & ML:** Reinforcement Learning (MARL, PPO, SAC), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Statistical Modeling.
* **Languages:** Python (Primary), Java, C++, Haskell, Prolog, SQL.
* **Tools & Concepts:** Git, Version Control, Unity ML-Agents, Algorithm Design, Data Structures, Agile Methodologies.

## Education

**Bachelor of Computer Science Honours, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Stream**  
Carleton University, Ottawa, ON, Canada | Graduated 2024
* **CGPA:** 10.92/12.0 (A- Average)
* **Scholarships:** Recipient of the Harry S. Southam Scholarship and President's Scholarship, and recognized on the Dean's Honour List (2020-2022).

## Let's Work Together

I am actively seeking full-time roles as an **AI Developer**, **Machine Learning Engineer**, or **Data Scientist**. I thrive in environments where I can leverage my research background and proven record of delivering efficient, high-impact technical solutions.
